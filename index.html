		<p>Hi there my name is Aron Yang! I like to code, and when I say like, I mean I <em>really</em> like to code! <br>It doesn't matter which language I use, I just find the process soothing (until it fails miserably).</p>
		<p>Python wasn't the first programming language I have learned, but it is the most <strong>fun</strong> in my opinion. There is just to much you can do!</p>
